DGMD E-28 Developing Single Page Web Applications Assignment 2: Tic Tac Toe

Part 1.1: ttt1.html

I haven’t written code since the end of last semester, so it was nice to work with grids and flexboxes again. I really enjoyed working with them last semester when creating a website, so it was cool to utilize them for something a little more basic. I also like the direction of the color scheme. I think it will look nice. I’m looking forward to using the project to clean up all the cobwebs.
