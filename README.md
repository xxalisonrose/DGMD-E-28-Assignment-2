DGMD E-28 Developing Single Page Web Applications Assignment 2: Tic Tac Toe

Part 1.1: ttt1.html

I haven’t written code since the end of last semester, so it was nice to work with grids and flexboxes again. I really enjoyed working with them last semester when creating a website, so it was cool to utilize them for something a little more basic. I also like the direction of the color scheme. I think it will look nice. I’m looking forward to using the project to clean up all the cobwebs.

Part 1.3: ttt3.html

I screwed up in part 2 where I didn't adjust the HTML/CSS to account for the JS code. I realized I had done done it in part 3, but never went back
to change it in part 2. I wish the assignment's objectives were a little clearer. I find them confusing and have to spend 10-15 minutes reaching them
out loud to myself to understand simple concepts.

However, I think by doing more of the design in JS instead of HTML/CCS, it's easier to read. Once you know the divs, you don't have to keep scrolling around to
adjust things. It's all right there. It looks cleaner too because the HTML isn't full of a ton of repeating divs.
